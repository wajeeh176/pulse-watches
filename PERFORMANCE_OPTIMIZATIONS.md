# Performance Optimizations for Pulse Watches

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Pulse Watches application.

## Client-Side Optimizations

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Implemented React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- Only loads JavaScript needed for the current route
- Reduces initial bundle size and improves first contentful paint

### React Optimizations
- Added memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Optimized filtering and sorting logic in product listings

### Build Optimizations
- Configured Vite for optimal production builds
- Added vendor chunk splitting for better caching
- Added Terser minification with console removal

### Image Optimization
- Added automated image optimization script
- Converts images to WebP format for better compression
- Resizes large images to appropriate dimensions
- Maintains quality while reducing file size

## Server-Side Optimizations

### Caching
- Implemented server-side caching with node-cache
- Added cache headers for browser caching
- Cached product listings and individual product data

### API Performance
- Added pagination to product listings
- Implemented filtering and sorting on the server
- Added proper error handling and request validation

### Server Infrastructure
- Added compression middleware for response compression
- Implemented clustering for multi-core utilization
- Added security headers with Helmet
- Optimized MongoDB connection settings
- Added graceful shutdown handling

### Database Optimizations
- Used lean() queries for better MongoDB performance
- Implemented proper error handling in database operations
- Added pagination to reduce query load

## How to Run the Optimized Application

### Server Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://wajeeh:pulsewatches@cluster0.drx1hgs.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
   JWT_SECRET=mySuperSecretKey123
   PORT=5000
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Client Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the client directory with:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. For production build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the performance of your application:
1. Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse for client-side performance
2. Use the Network tab to analyze request/response times
3. Monitor server performance with tools like PM2

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a CDN for static assets
2. Add service workers for offline capabilities
3. Implement server-side rendering for better SEO and initial load performance
4. Consider using a more robust caching solution like Redis for production
